I am a researcher at a pharmaceutical company, and I now need to extract the necessary information from medical documents.

The text between two "---" is part of a detailed protocol for a Phase 1/2/3 study sponsored by BioNTech and conducted by Pfizer, regarding the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidates against COVID-19 in healthy individuals.
It includes extensive information on the study's rationale, objectives, design, population, interventions, and the statistical considerations for data analysis.

Now please determine whether this section involves human genetic resources materials. If not involved at all, please output N/A.
If it does involve, please output the name of the human genetic resources material, and list the attributes that can be extracted from this text section between the two "***" as follows:
***
